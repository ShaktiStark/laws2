  <h2>ADULTERY</h2>

  <p>Adultery is a legal term that typically refers to the act of engaging in sexual intercourse with someone other than one's spouse while being married</p>

  <p>Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 497</p>

  <p>Legal Status After 2018: As of September 2018, the Supreme Court of India, in the case of Joseph Shine v. Union of India, declared Section 497 of the IPC unconstitutional. Adultery is no longer considered a criminal offense in India, and individuals cannot be criminally prosecuted for engaging in consensual sexual relations outside of marriage.</p>

  <p>Civil Actions: While adultery is no longer a criminal offense, it can still have implications in civil matters such as divorce. Adultery can be considered as a ground for divorce, and it may affect the distribution of property, alimony, or child custody arrangements, depending on the circumstances and the discretion of the court.</p>
